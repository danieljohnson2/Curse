Curse

A rogue-like set in the great outdoors!

A little C project using ncurses, makefiles, and all that. It's very old-school.

The island is generated using perlin noise. Your goal is to collect all the gold,
but watch out- the monsters will steal it too, when not trying to eat you.
You'll have to kill them to steal it back.

When you get all the gold, you'll move on to a new random island with more
and tougher monsters, without your inventory.

You can collect weapons, armor, and healing potions too.

Use the arrow keys to move, 'i' to equip items or use potions, 's' to save
the game, 'l' to load the last save, and 'q' to quit.
